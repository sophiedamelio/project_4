# songSpace

This app serves as a hub for all the songs you want to play and practice. You can use it as a library for ease of access and paste in other folks' songs, or use it as a space to keep track of all the songs you have written yourself. You can add songs, edit songs, and select songs to display as you play along.

### Planned future enhancements:
- AAU, I want to choose how fast my autoscroll is

- AAU, I want click 'share' on a composition and be given options of links, etc to share outside of app

- AAU, select 'current work' on a composition, that one is the default display on index (replacing the first composition as default. Only one 'current work' at a time)

- AAU, I want to be able to add Tags on songs for what instrument they are with (guitar, ukulele, vocal/melody only, piano, bass, other)

- AAU, when I add or update a song, have it scroll up to the top of the page

- AAU, I want to see an about page, linked in the footer for both logged in and logged out views

- AAU, have a toggle where I can change from 'dark mode' to 'light mode'
